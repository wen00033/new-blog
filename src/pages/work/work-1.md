Using unstyle Tailwind components to style this page, for this project I have learned how to get data from firebase, including get the data from the cloud and also update cloud document. I have added an random people api to able generate a contact and uploaded to documents. I have completed this project by React and React-router and AXIOS also Lodash package.
