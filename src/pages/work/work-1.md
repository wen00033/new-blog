Using unstyle Tailwind components to style this page, for this project I have learned how to get data from Firebase, including getting the data from the cloud and also updating cloud documents. I have added a random people API to generate a contact and upload it to documents. I have completed this project by React React-router and AXIOS as well as the Lodash package.
